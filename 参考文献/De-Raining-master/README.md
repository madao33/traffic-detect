# De-Raining
This is a part of BITS Pilani , Goa Neural Networks course in this project we had to remove rain and snow from images in which rain was
added through photoshop . I used a Denoising autoencoder for this project . Another alternative was using  Image De-raining Conditional 
General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN) inspired by paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05957 . By using autoencoder I got a psnr of almost 28 
on training data and 23 on testing data . The data is same as given in the paper . Testing accuracy was above 80 percent .
